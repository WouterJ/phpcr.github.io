title: Update June 2014
---

Welcome to the first monthly news item. From now on we will try, on the first of each
month, to publish a post which details all the new developments, big and small, which
have taken place within the PHPCR ecosystem.

## News

### Documentation

[David Buchmann](https://github.com/dbu) wrote a great and extensive tutorial on PHPCR some years ago,
but it has been hiding in the [phpcr-docs](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-docs) repository.

We have now adapted this tutorial to the restructured text format and made it into
a **book** instead of a **tutorial**. It is hosted it on
[Readthedocs.org](https://phpcr.readthedocs.org).

This will become the offical location of all future PHPCR documentation.

There has also been a proposal for hosting a restructured text version of the JCR spec
on the documenatation site
