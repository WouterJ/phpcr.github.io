title: Update June 2014
---

Welcome to the first monthly news item. From now on we will try, on the first of each
month, to publish a post which details all the new developments, big and small, which
have taken place within the PHPCR ecosystem.

## News

### Documentation

[David Buchmann](https://github.com/dbu) wrote a great and extensive tutorial on PHPCR some years ago,
but it has been hiding in the [phpcr-docs](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-docs) repository.

We have now adapted this tutorial to the restructured text format and made it into
a **book** instead of a **tutorial**. It is hosted it on
[Readthedocs.org](https://phpcr.readthedocs.org).

This will become the offical location of all future PHPCR documentation.

There has also been a [proposal](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-docs/pull/8) for hosting a restructured text version of the JCR spec
on the documenatation site

### Marmelab PHPCR Browser supports Doctrine DBAL

The [Marmelab PHPCR browser](https://github.com/marmelab/phpcr-browser) now officially supports Doctrine-DBAL

## Jackalope

- [Discussion](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit/issues/88) about concurrent writes in Jackalope-Jackrabbit
- [Discussion](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit/pull/72) about throwing exceptions with invalid parameters: The PHPCR spec specifies to return null on invalid connection parameters - but this makes it hard to debug - should we violate the PHPCR spec or make an amendment?

## Development Summary

### PHPCR Utils

- [Fixed bug](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-utils/pull/115) with escaping fulltext search literal when converting from QOM to SQL2.

### PHPCR Shell

- [Alpha 3](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-shell/releases) was released on the 9th of June.
- [New option](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-shell/pull/32) added to show defined but unpopulated nodes and properties.
- [PR](ttps://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-shell/pull/56) for showing node contents in XML with syntax highlighting. 
- [PR](https://github.com/phpcr/phpcr-shell/pull/40) to support embedding the shell in Symfony applications (we are thinking about replacing all the PHPCR Util commands in the DoctrinePHPCRBundle with the PHPCR Shell).
